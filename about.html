            <h3>Our History </h3>
            <p><strong> The knights was suppose to be just a group nothing else but a sudden change of mind made promoted us to open a network</strong>. It was 2022 when deadly knight (founder of knights) opened a group named (get all your anime series and movies here) and slowly members started to join the group. on march 15 someone named shouko joined the network... he motivated everyone to change the group name and earned the trust of the founder.. slowly they became best friends and shouko became the manager of the group</p>
            <p>suddenly someone named dyno entered the group and tried to destroy it.. but somehow he couldn't... he had three accounts and later was gbanned by shouko...</p>
            
            <h3>Birth of the network</h3>
            <p>shouko was so good at handling bots and made an own personal bot for the knights group, which made the owner hapy and satisfied and then the shouko was granted as the co-owner of the group.. as you know "great power comes with great responsiblities" so he is responsible for the managing the group and namedas owner...</p>
            <p>suddenly some guys named kirito and serena ayako joined the group<strong>so an admin of the knights direct messaged a girl which was 18+ and dirty message</strong>... and he repeated the same thing in the group again.. so she got angry and started blocking his phone number and her boyfriend kirito slayed and gbanned him from some bots.. by seeing serena ayako as telegram official, she was appoited as an admin in knights along with kirito.. later on everyone in the group were talking about sudos and network stuffs... so the founders oh the knights thought opening a network but to do this, they needed help of serena ayako and kirito to advice them and order them what to do as they are admins in other 2 networks too...and they opened a network finally but due to some personal problems, shouko cant able be online in tg as much.. so someone named "ᴾᴿᴵᴹᴱ LOST ⋆『最高』" does the same job as me and declined to get the credits or be admin in the knights... hence we gave birth to our official network...</p>
